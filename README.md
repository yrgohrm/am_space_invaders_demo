# Space invaders demo project

This is a very basic space invaders demo for use in one of my classes to show some basic Swing/AWT code.

This is not a good example of how to make a game, it is just there to give some hints as to what one could do to create a very basic game.

## Building

Simply compile all the files with `javac App.java`.

## Running

Run the app with `java App`.
